# React Bootstrap Layout Refactoring

This document outlines the modern, professional layout implemented using React Bootstrap that is both desktop and mobile responsive.

## Overview of Changes

### 1. Implemented Components
- **ThemeContext**: Provides light/dark mode toggle functionality using Bootstrap's built-in theming capabilities
- **NavBar**: Responsive navigation with theme toggle button
- **ImageGrid**: Flexible image display with responsive card layout
- **SearchForm**: Consistent form styling with proper spacing
- **Pagination**: Enhanced pagination with first/last buttons and ellipsis for large datasets
- **Homepage**: Redesigned main component with consistent spacing and responsive layout

### 2. Key Features
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Implemented using Bootstrap's data-bs-theme attribute
- **Responsive Design**: All components automatically adapt to different screen sizes
- **Consistent Typography**: Using Bootstrap's built-in typography system
- **Proper Spacing**: Consistent margins and padding throughout
- **Component Reusability**: All components can be easily reused across the application

### 3. Technical Implementation
- Used official React Bootstrap components instead of raw Bootstrap classes
- Theme state is stored in localStorage for persistence
- Added custom transitions for smooth theme switching
- Maintained semantic HTML structure throughout

## Maintenance Guide

### 1. Component Structure
- Components are now located in the `/src/components/` directory
- Page layouts are in `/src/pages/`
- Theme context and custom styles are at the root level

### 2. Adding New Components
When adding new components, follow these patterns:
- Import the `useTheme` hook to access the current theme
- Use responsive React Bootstrap components
- Follow the consistent styling patterns established

### 3. Theme Customization
- Main theme switching is handled by `ThemeContext.jsx`
- Custom styles are in `custom-theme.css`
- To extend theme-specific styles, use the attribute selector: `[data-bs-theme="dark"]` or `[data-bs-theme="light"]`

### 4. Responsive Considerations
- The layout is built mobile-first
- Key breakpoints: sm (576px), md (768px), lg (992px), xl (1200px)
- Use Bootstrap's responsive utilities (e.g., `d-none d-md-block`)

## Future Improvements

### 1. Potential Enhancements
- Add additional theme options beyond light/dark
- Implement animation transitions between page routes
- Create a component library with storybook documentation

### 2. Accessibility
- Current implementation follows Bootstrap's accessibility patterns
- Consider adding ARIA labels to interactive elements
- Test with screen readers to ensure compatibility

### 3. Performance
- Components are relatively lightweight
- Consider lazy loading images or implementing a virtualized list for large image galleries

## Quick Reference

### Theme Context Usage
```jsx
import { useTheme } from '../ThemeContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
  
  return (
    <div className={theme === 'dark' ? 'bg-dark text-light' : 'bg-light text-dark'}>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Bootstrap Grid System
```jsx
<Container>
  <Row>
    <Col xs={12} md={6} lg={4}>Column 1</Col>
    <Col xs={12} md={6} lg={4}>Column 2</Col>
    <Col xs={12} md={6} lg={4}>Column 3</Col>
  </Row>
</Container>
```

### Component Props
Most components accept theme-related props:
- `NavBar`: Automatically adapts to current theme
- `ImageGrid`: Accepts customizable grid class names
- `Pagination`: Shows appropriate styling based on theme
- `SearchForm`: Dynamically styles form elements based on theme
